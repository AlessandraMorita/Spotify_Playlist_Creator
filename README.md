 ## Why?
 
 I wanted to practice my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website. I also want to create features that make easy to create playlists. All upgrades and challenges are a plus in the original project.

 ## Features
 
 * Users can search for songs by song title, artist and/or album
 * Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
 * Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account
 * Songs removed from the playlist are returned to the search results list
 * Users can't add the same song twice in the playlist
 * Users can't save empty playlist
 * Playlist and search informations donâ€™t get cleared if the the access token has to be refreshed
 
 ## How To Use?
 
 You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.
